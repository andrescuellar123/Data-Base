# People data management software

This is a program that generates a quantity of data of people with random data, to be added to 4 AVL trees, they are created according to: name, lastname and name with lastname.


**Data generation**

Here you can generate a large number of random elements represented by people.

**Capstone-homework part 2**

In the second part of the delivery of the Capstone-homework we made the corrections indicated by the monitor. Regarding the design we added to the diagram classes that were missing for the complete development (Trie, ABB and RedBlackTree), the unit tests were also implemented to the diagram (for the AVLTree, ABB, Trie, RedBlackTree classes). In the coding part, the ABB tree and the Trie were implemented (with their due tests) and finally the implementation of the word predictor was also corrected using the Trie. In addition we correct the report of the engineering method specifically phases 3, 4 and 5. The context of the problem has been theoretically improved
